# Portare Folium - KMP Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio, reimagined as a fully-native Kotlin Multiplatform application. It's designed to showcase my projects and skills in a modern, responsive, and cross-platform way.

The app is built entirely with **Compose Multiplatform** and runs on **Android, iOS, Desktop, and Web**.

## Features

This project serves as a practical demonstration of modern KMP development, incorporating a wide range of best practices and libraries:

* **100% Kotlin Multiplatform:** A single shared codebase for all business logic and UI.
* **Highly Responsive UI:** A single, adaptable UI built with Compose that looks great on any screen size, from a phone to a desktop monitor. (Go ahead, try to break the UI!)
* **Material 3 Design:** Implements the latest Material Design 3 principles, components, and icons.
* **Custom Theming:** Uses a full custom color palette generated with the [Material Theme Builder](https://material-foundation.github.io/material-theme-builder/) for a unique, consistent look.
* **Custom Internationalization (i18n):** Features a custom-built, type-safe solution for app localization.
* **Multiplatform Data Persistence:** Uses **KStore** for simple, type-safe key-value storage, persisting user preferences (like the selected language) across all platforms.
* **Custom Composable Components:** Features a variety of custom-built UI elements to create a unique user experience..
* **Modern Architecture:** Built with a clean MVVM architecture using **Jetpack/Compose ViewModel** for state management.
* **Dependency Injection:** Uses **Koin** for dependency injection across all shared source sets (common, android, jvm, etc.).
* **Type-Safe Navigation:** Leverages **Jetpack/Compose Navigation** for screen transitions.
* **Fast Development Cycle:** Integrates the **Compose Hot Reload** plugin for near-instant UI updates during development.
